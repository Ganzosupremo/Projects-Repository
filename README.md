# Projects-Repository
A repo with the source code of the projects I'm currently working on.

## Project BOne
On this folder are all the source code for my first project, it's like a roguelike dungeon gunner, where you fight your way in a dungeon, and try to reach the end,
if you die, you restart from the beginning.

## SnakeGame
Is the normal and well-know snake game, but there are enemies, and the snake can have guns. I almost finish this game, just some bugs that need to be fixed.

## Hashneer
This is a normal farming RPG but instead of farming crops you farm bitcoin. I just started this project and I'm trying to make the most similar posible to real mining
without being real, like seudomining, or somethin' like that. Once I get that ready, then the rest of the RPG is gonna be developed.
